# Web Components for Boomi

Hi there 👋  
This is a starting point for building a standalone Web Component using [Stencil](https://github.com/ionic-team/stencil) and [Storybook](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook) with addon controls.


## 👩‍💻 Usage
To build the component and run Storybook, run:
```bash
npm start
```
To generate a new component, run: 
```bash
npm run generate <sub-folder>
```
